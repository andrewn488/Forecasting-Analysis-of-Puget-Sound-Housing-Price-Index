**Purpose:**

In the Puget Sound region, housing price growth has exploded in recent months and house prices in general have increased from 1975 to present. It has become vital to lenders, individuals, and government officials to monitor changes in house prices over time to appropriately plan for home ownership and changes in housing affordability at scale. Our team investigated how house prices have changed in the last 45 years and compared price changes between pre-COVID-19 pandemic to post-COVID-19 pandemic time frames.

**Research Question:**

How did the COVID-19 pandemic (“the pandemic”) impact the behavior of the housing price index and what is the appropriate forecasting scheme (Fixed, Recursive, or Rolling) that will help us best forecast the housing price index values after the pandemic?

**Data:**

Freddie Mac House Price Index (FMPHI) available at http://www.freddiemac.com/research/indices/house-price-index.page.

**Conclusion:**

The AR(3) and AR(16) forecasts are very similar during the first half of 2020. Like all the models, the forecasts for the first half of 2020 lag the actual market behavior by about 30-45 days. We also note that the forecasts become more accurate during the second half of 2020. Based on the plots, after mid-2020, the AR(16) model becomes the better predictor of market behavior. Both models are statistically significant models, but the AR(16) model better captures the volatility of the housing prices in Puget Sound during the pandemic. It was found that the Recursive scheme is more representative than the Fixed and Rolling schemes.
