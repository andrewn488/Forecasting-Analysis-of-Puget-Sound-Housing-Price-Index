Introduction
=======================================

+Forecasting Housing Prices

- Housing price growth has exploded in recent months and house prices in general have increased from 1975 onward.
- Vital to lenders, individuals, and government officials to monitor changes in house prices over time to appropriately plan for home ownership and changes in housing affordability at scale.

+Research Question

- How did the pandemic impact the behavior of the housing price index and what is the appropriate scheme (fixed, recursive, or rolling) that will help us best forecast the housing price index values after the pandemic?


Data Description
=========================================

We used the Freddie Mac House Price Index (FMPHI) available at http://www.freddiemac.com/research/indices/house-price-index.page.

- The FMHPI provides a measure of typical price inflation for houses within the United States.
- Values are calculated monthly and released at the end of the following month.
- The data includes seasonally and non-seasonally adjusted series which are available at three different geographical levels (metropolitan, state, and national).
- The data set includes each month from January 1975 onward.

What are conditions when he does score more?
=========================================

+ Narrowed analysis down to 40+ point games
+ Removed 69 point game as that is once in a lifetime (12th highest total ever)
+ Michael Jordan scored 40+ points 132 times
  - Cleveland 12, Milwaukee 11, New York and Boston 10 

Over 40 Points - Months
=========================================

+ Average per game when over 40 points is close across months
  - March is highest



Over 40 Points - Days
=========================================

+ Average per game when over 40 points is different across days
  - Wednesday is highest by a large margin
  - Thursday close as well


Conclusion
=========================================

+ Based on the analysis related to games in which Michael Jordan scored at least 40 points I suggest:
  - March
  - Wednesday or Thursday
  - Against Cleveland, Milwaukee, New York or Boston
  
+ Washington Wizards play the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday, March 29
