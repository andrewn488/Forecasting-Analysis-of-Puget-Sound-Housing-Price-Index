+ Forecasting Housing Prices

Housing price growth has exploded in recent months and house prices in general have increased from 1975 onward. It has become vital to lenders, individuals, and government officials to monitor changes in house prices over time to appropriately plan for home ownership and changes in housing affordability at scale. We want to investigate how house prices have changed in the last decade and compare pre-pandemic to post-pandemic price changes.

+Research Question

How did the pandemic impact the behavior of the housing price index and what is the appropriate scheme (fixed, recursive, or rolling) that will help us best forecast the housing price index values after the pandemic?

+ Data Description

We used the Freddie Mac House Price Index (FMPHI) available at http://www.freddiemac.com/research/indices/house-price-index.page.

Per the Freddie Mac website "the FMHPI provides a measure of typical price inflation for houses within the United States. Values are calculated monthly and released at the end of the following month. For example, the FMHPI for March is published in late April." The data includes seasonally and non-seasonally adjusted series which are available at three different geographical levels (metropolitan, state, and national)for each month going all the way back to January 1975.

For our forecasting analysis we split the data into 3 sections based on the changes in the graph of NSA index over time. There is the 2011-presnet section and we then identified 2011-2019 as pre-pandemic and 2020-2021 as post-pandemic.

# Fetch Data

+ Data wrangling: 

    + filter geography for 'Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue WA'
    + create new column for 'YearMonth' concatenating to be %Y-%m-%d format
    + focus on Index_SA data (Seasonally Adjusted)
    + declare as Time Series
    
## Read in data and wrangle

```{r fetch_data}
# read in data
data <- read_csv("../02_raw_data/fmhpi_master_file.csv")

# filter for target GEO
puget <- data %>% 
  filter(GEO_Type == 'CBSA', GEO_Name == 'Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue WA')

# add YearMonth column
puget$YearMonth <- as.Date(with(puget, paste(Year, Month, 1, sep="-")),"%Y-%m-%d")

# pull columns from dataset we need for forecasting
puget <- puget[, c('YearMonth', 'Index_SA')]

# look at our data
head(puget, 10)

# declare as ts
puget_ts <- ts(puget$Index_SA, frequency=12, start=1975)  # monthly data
```

# Data Exploration

## Examine Data

```{r}
# plot using ggplot
ggplot(puget, aes(YearMonth, puget_ts)) + 
  geom_line() + scale_x_date('Year') + 
  labs(y = "Seasonally Adjusted Index",
       title = "Seasonally Adjusted housing index trends of:",
       subtitle = "Seattle, Tacoma, and Bellevue, Washington") +
  theme_classic()
```

**Comments**
+ ggplot plot looks exactly the same as using Base R but with more flexibility to add layers

```{r}

# try cleaning the data
puget_ts <- ts(puget[, c('Index_SA')])
puget$clean_index_sa <- tsclean(puget_ts)

ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data = puget, aes(x = YearMonth, y = clean_index_sa)) + ylab('Cleaned Index SA')
```

**Comments**

+ cleaning the data using tsclean() does not have an effect on our dataset
+ no outliers to clean

```{r}
# plot the cleaned series
# get MA(4) - quarterly MA
puget$sa_ma04 = ma(puget$clean_index_sa, order=4) # using the clean count with no outliers, get the MA

# get MA(12) - yearly MA
puget$sa_ma12 = ma(puget$clean_index_sa, order=12) # MA(12)

ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data = puget, aes(x = YearMonth, y = clean_index_sa, colour = "Raw Data")) +
  geom_line(data = puget, aes(x = YearMonth, y = sa_ma04,   colour = "Quarterly Moving Average"))  +
  geom_line(data = puget, aes(x = YearMonth, y = sa_ma12, colour = "Yearly Moving Average"))  +
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "SA Index",
       title = "Quarterly MA vs. Yearly MA") + 
  theme_classic()
```

**Comments**

+ yearly MA appears to be a slightly smoother fit to our raw data plot
+ quarterly MA follows along almost spot on

## Decompose Data

+ Seasonality, Trend, Cycle to capture historical patterns in the series
+ Seasonality - fluctuations in the data related to calendar cycles
+ Trend - overall pattern of the series
+ Cycle - decreasing or increasing patterns that are not seasonal

```{r}
# Seasonality
sa_ma <- ts(puget$Index_SA, frequency=12)

decomp <- stl(sa_ma, s.window="periodic")  # additive model structure
deseasonal_sa <- seasadj(decomp)  # remove seasonality
plot(decomp, main="Additive model structure")

```

**Comments**

+ Not sure what this is telling us
+ why is time not in my time window?
+ definitely trending upwards

## Stationarity

```{r}
# run ADF test
adf.test(sa_ma, alternative = "stationary")
```

**Comments**

+ dickey-fuller test indicates a very high p-value
+ do these results indicate a stationary process?


```{r}
# calculate differences
count_d1 = diff(deseasonal_sa, differences = 1)
plot(count_d1)
adf.test(count_d1, alternative = "stationary")
```


**Comments**

+ dickey-fuller test indicates a high p-value
+ do these results indicate a stationary process?


```{r}
# plot differenced ACF 
Acf(count_d1, main='ACF for Differenced Series')

# difference PACF
Pacf(count_d1, main='PACF for Differenced Series')
```

**Comments**

+ ACF:

    + spikes do not pass significance threshold until lag 11
    + distribution appears to be sinusoidal
    
+ PACF:

    + spike passes significance threshold at lag 4
    + distribution is somewhat oscilating

## Fitting an ARIMA model

```{r}
# Fit the ARIMA model
auto.arima(deseasonal_sa, seasonal=FALSE)
```

**Comments**

+ p = 0
+ d = 2
+ q = 3
+ ARIMA Fitted Model
    
    + y_hat = 0.7689e_t-1 -0.2475e_t-2 - 0.4647e_t-3 + E
